## 7.1-1
Using Figure 7.1 as a model, illustrate the operation of PARTITION on the array A = [13, 19, 9, 5, 12, 8, 7, 4, 21, 2, 6, 11].

#### `Answer`
Left as an excercise for the reader.

## 7.1-2
What value of q does **PARTITION** return when all elements in the array A[p .. r]  have the same value? Modify **PARTITION** so that q = ceil((p+r)/2) when all elements in the array A[p .. r]   have the same value.

#### `Answer`

If all elements are equal, **PARTITION** will return the last index of A, **i.e.** r for **PARTITION(A, p, r)**.

Modified **PARTITION(A, p, r)**:

````
def Partition(A, p, r):
	x = A[r]
	i = p - 1
	sum = 0
	
	# check if all elements are equal
	for k in range(i+1, r):
		sum += r ^ A[k]
		
	if not sum:
		return ceil((p+r)/2)
	
	for j in range(i+1, r):
		if A[j] <= x:
			i+=1
			A[j], A[i] = A[i], A[j]
	# swap pivot where it belongs
	A[i+1], A[r] = A[r], A[i+1]
	return i+1
````

## 7.1-3
Give a brief argument that the running time of PARTITION on a subarray of size n is Theta(n).

#### `Answer`

Because **PARTITION** must go over the entire array, whatever all the elements are equal or not.

## 7.1-4
How would you modify **QUICKSORT** to sort into nonincreasing order?

#### `Answer`

Just change `if A[j] <= x:` to `if A[j] >= x:`
in **Partition**.
