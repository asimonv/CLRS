What is the running time of QUICKSORT when all elements of array A have the same value?

#### `Answer`
```
def quicksort(A, p, r):
	if p < r:
		q = partition(A, p, r)
		quicksort(A, p, q-1)
		quicksort(A, q+1, r)
```
When all elements are equal, then the running time of **QUICKSORT** belongs to O(n^2) because the pivot will remain at the last position everytime. **PARTITION** will divide the subarray into [p..r-1] and [], **i.e** n - 1 and 0 elements at each iteration, so the recurrence equation will be T(n) = T(n-1) + Theta(n) (**QUICKSORT**(n-1 elements) + **QUICKSORT**(0 elements) + **PARTITION**(n elements), which leads to the solution T(n) = Theta(n^2).

Show that the running time of QUICKSORT is Theta(n^2) when the array A contains distinct elements and is sorted in decreasing order.
