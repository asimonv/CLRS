## 7.2-1
Use the substitution method to prove that the recurrence T(n) = T(n-1) + Theta(n) has the solution T(n) = Theta(n^2), as claimed at the beginning of Section 7.2.

#### `Answer`
Left as an excercise for the reader.

What is the running time of QUICKSORT when all elements of array A have the same value?

#### `Answer`
```
def quicksort(A, p, r):
	if p < r:
		q = partition(A, p, r)
		quicksort(A, p, q-1)
		quicksort(A, q+1, r)
```
When all elements are equal, then the running time of **QUICKSORT** belongs to O(n^2) because the pivot will remain at the last position everytime. **PARTITION** will divide the subarray into [p..r-1] and [], **i.e** n - 1 and 0 elements at each iteration, so the recurrence equation will be T(n) = T(n-1) + Theta(n) (**QUICKSORT**(n-1 elements) + **QUICKSORT**(0 elements) + **PARTITION**(n elements), which leads to the solution T(n) = Theta(n^2).

## 7.2-3
Show that the running time of QUICKSORT is Theta(n^2) when the array A contains distinct elements and is sorted in decreasing order.

#### `Answer`
This case is just like when every element in A has the same value, but instead, the returned index will be the first in the subarray, **i.e.** p. **PARTITION** will divide A[p .. r] of n elements, into [] and [q+1 .. r], where [q+1 .. r] has n-1 elements, so the recurrence equation will be the same as the case where every element is equal: T(n) = Theta(n^2).


## 7.2-4
Banks often record transactions on an account in order of the times of the transac- tions, but many people like to receive their bank statements with checks listed in order by check number. People usually write checks in order by check number, and merchants usually cash them with reasonable dispatch. The problem of converting time-of-transaction ordering to check-number ordering is therefore the problem of sorting almost-sorted input. Argue that the procedure INSERTION-SORT would tend to beat the procedure QUICKSORT on this problem.

#### `Answer`
Due to the fact that the array is relatively sorted, the running time of **QUICKSORT** would be near O(n^2), because the pivot index for each iteration would be near the end everytime, which leads to very unbalanced partitions. On the other hand, the running time of **INSERTION-SORT** would be near O(n) because there wouldn't be a lot of position changes by element.
