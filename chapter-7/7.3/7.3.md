## 7.3-1
Why do we analyze the expected running time of a randomized algorithm and not its worst-case running time?

#### `Answer`
Because the worst case for **RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT** is highly unlikely to happen because it will only occur when the random exchanged pivot is put in an index where the entire subarray is sorted.

## 7.3-2
When **RANDOMIZED-QUICKSORT** runs, how many calls are made to the random- number generator **RANDOM** in the worst case? How about in the best case? Give your answer in terms of Θ-notation.

#### `Answer`
In the worst case, **RANDOM** will be called Θ(n) times (T(n) = T(n-1) + Θ(1) = Θ(n)). On the other hand, it will be called Θ(n) times too (T(n) = 2T(n/2) + Θ(1) = Θ(n)).
